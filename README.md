# OBrien_Zane-Final-Project
CSCI 2270

Project	Summary:
  My project builds off of Assignment 9 which only allowed the user to insert, delete, find, and display movies that were entered in by the user. My Final project allows the user to have many more options like selling movies, sorting the movies by year, sorting alphabetically (A-Z), displaying money made from selling movies, and displaying movies from a certain time period. Each movie struct will now include a price. 
  
How to Run:
To compile files use these commands: g++ -std=c++11 MovieSeller.cpp main.cpp -o main

To run program: ./main

  The user is immediately prompted with a main menu:
  
  ======Main Menu======
  1. Insert movie
  2. Delete movie
  3. Find movie in inventory
  4. Sort by Year (Ascending)
  5. Sort by Name (A-Z)
  6. Sell Movie
  7. Print movies sold
  8. Print current inventory
  9. Show hash table
  10. Print movies in time range
  11. Total Profit
  12. Quit
  
  // The user can choose from all of these option

  // The most common input is inserting a movie
  
  // Here is an example of inserting a movie into the inventory
  
  1
  
  Enter Title:
  
  "Toy Story"
  
  Enter Year:
  
  1995
  
  Enter price:
  
  20
  
  // this will enter "Toy Story" with a year of 1995 and a price of $20 into the inventory Hashtable

Open	issues/bugs
- The way I had to implement the Bubble sort function seems to be really inefficent.      -fixed 
- Improve the printHash Table funtion, hard to visualize the hashTable.                   - fixed 
- maybe add a feature to read movie in from a txt file                                    - fixed
